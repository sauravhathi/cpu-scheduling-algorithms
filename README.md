Create a website for CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, Priority Scheduling(non preemptive) and Priority Scheduling (Preemptive)). On clicking any algorithm, the page must display the working of the algorithm and have a working model of it. For instance, for priority scheduling, the working model should take input from the user related.
